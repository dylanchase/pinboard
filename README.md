HTML exporter for Taskwarrior based on Pinboard HTML available at http://taskwarrior.org/projects/taskwarrior/wiki/ExternalScripts
My version just adds the time that the export was performed at and a wrapper 
shell script which redirects the html to a file.  In my case I redirect the file 
to a dropbox folder.
